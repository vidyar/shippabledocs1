nodejs 
======

This section helps you to configure the yml file for your node_js project.

**Node_js versions for testing** :

- Tell us what your build environment is. This is an optional setting and if omitted Ubuntu 12.04 is used as the default.
    .. code-block:: bash
    
        # Build Environment
              build_environment: ubuntu1204

- Set the appropriate language and the version number. You can test against multiple versions for a single push by adding more entries. node_js minions use ``node_js`` by default to set the version.
    .. code-block:: bash
	
	# language setting
	language: node_js
	
	# version numbers
	node_js:
  	  - "0.11"
	  - "0.10"
          - "0.8"
          - "0.6"

.. note::
 We are setting multiple versions of node_js here which means a single push to repo will trigger multiple builds. 

**Test scripts**

- To run your test suites using NPM, specify it using script key.  
	.. code-block:: bash
		
		script: npm test

-  You can also add testing frameworks like Vows, Expresso in the package.json file.

-  To test using Vows:
	.. code-block:: python 	

            "scripts": {
              "test": "vows --spec"
        	} 

-  To test using Expresso:
	.. code-block:: python
	    
             "scripts": {
               "test": "expresso test "
        	}

-  You can also install your project dependencies using `NPM <http://npmjs.org/>`_
	.. code-block:: python
	   
              node_js:
	          - "0.10"
	      before_install: npm install -g grunt-cli
      
-  Keep the output of test and code coverage generated in the Shippable folders to get the visualization of your reports.

-  If your test runner uses the junit format, then you can save the output in shippable/testresults folder so that shippable can parse the test reports. You can also save the output of code coverage in shippable/codecoverage folder so that shippable can parse the coverage reports.
